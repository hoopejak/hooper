Neuroaesthetics is a subdiscipline within cognitive neuroscience which describes the biological mechanisms of aesthetic experiences. These experiences encompass perceptions and evaluations of natural objects, artwork, and environments that are ubiquitous in daily life. Empirical research demonstrates that aesthetic experiences arise from an interplay of sensory, affective, and semantic processes. Neuroaesthetics is becoming an established scientific pursuit just as modern psychedelic research begins to develop. Psychedelics can profoundly alter perceptions and evaluations, positioning them as a valuable tool to advance research into the neural basis of aesthetic experience. As the central goal of this article, we identify several synergies between psychedelic and cognitive neuroscience to motivate research using psychedelics to advance neuroaesthetics. To achieve this, we explore psychedelic changes to aesthetic experiences in terms of their sensory, affective, and semantic effects, suggesting their value to understand the neural mechanisms in this process. Throughout the article, we leverage existing theoretical frameworks to best describe the unique ways psychedelics influence aesthetic experience. Finally, we offer a preliminary agenda by suggesting future research avenues and their implications.

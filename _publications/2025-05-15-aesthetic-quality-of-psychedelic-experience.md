Introduction: The aesthetic qualities of psychedelic experiences have long been documented, but their specific contribution to therapeutic outcomes remains understudied. Aesthetic experiences may facilitate emotional breakthroughs and cognitive shifts, potentially playing a crucial role in the lasting psychological benefits observed following psychedelic use.

Methods: This cross-sectional study surveyed 96 individuals who reported using classic psychedelics (e.g., psilocybin, LSD, DMT, mescaline) within the past year. Participants completed validated measures including the Mystical Experience Questionnaire (MEQ), Emotional Breakthrough Inventory (EBI), Psychological Insight Scale (PIS), Challenging Experience Questionnaire (CEQ), and a novel measure of aesthetic experience (PAEQ). Linear regression and Spearman correlations were used to assess associations between aesthetic experience and psychological outcomes.

Results: Aesthetic experience was significantly associated with greater emotional breakthrough (r = .40), psychological insight (r = .48), behavioral change (r = .55), and mystical experience (r = .49) (all p < .001). Aesthetic experience was also inversely associated with fear (r = –.24, p < .05) and paranoia (r = –.36, p < .001). Regression models indicated aesthetic quality predicted improvements in depression, anxiety, and quality of life, independent of age, gender, or mystical experience.

Discussion: These findings suggest that aesthetic aspects of psychedelic experiences are not merely perceptual enhancements but may actively contribute to therapeutic outcomes. The inverse relationship between aesthetic quality and challenging experiences highlights the potential utility of optimizing the aesthetic environment in psychedelic-assisted therapy. Future research should further validate the PAEQ and explore causal mechanisms using longitudinal and experimental designs.

In this double‑blind pilot trial, participants with alcohol use disorder received hemp‑derived cannabidiol or placebo over several weeks.  
Outcomes assessed included safety, tolerability, craving and drinking behaviour. The results support further investigation of cannabidiol as a potential adjunct treatment.
